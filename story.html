        <p>Phones have been living for years. They have been living since 1876.
There were 14.02 phones in 2020. Phones are one of the greatest technologies in the world. 
	The cellular telephone is a small device that sends and receives voice calls and often other messages via wireless radio signals. Alexander Graham Bell made the telephone in 1876. In the early 2000s, cell phones became more numerous than traditional landline phones throughout the world. The telephone was just one of many new inventions that changed the way Americans lived and worked. If phones didn't exist today people would have to drive or walk to their friend's house to communicate with them which would waste your energy and will also make you tired. Phones can change the way Americans lived and worked. Cell phones have certainly made our lives much more convenient.
